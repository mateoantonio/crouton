<p>crouton is a set of scripts that bundle up into an easy-to-use,
Chromium OS-centric chroot generator. Currently Ubuntu and Debian are
supported (using debootstrap behind the scenes), but "Chromium OS Debian,
Ubuntu, and Probably Other Distros Eventually Chroot Environment" doesn't
acronymize as well (crodupodece is admittedly pretty fun to say, though).</p>

<h2>
<a name="croutonan-acronym" class="anchor" href="#croutonan-acronym"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>"crouton"...an acronym?</h2>

<p>It stands for <em>ChRomium Os Universal chrooT envirONment</em>
...or something like that. Do capitals really matter if caps-lock has been
(mostly) banished, and the keycaps are all lower-case?</p>

<p>Moving on...</p>

<h2>
<a name="whos-this-for" class="anchor" href="#whos-this-for"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who's this for?</h2>

<p>Anyone who wants to run straight Linux on their Chromium OS device, and doesn't
care about physical security. You're also better off having some knowledge of
Linux tools and the command line in case things go funny, but it's not strictly
necessary.</p>

<h2>
<a name="whats-a-chroot" class="anchor" href="#whats-a-chroot"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's a chroot?</h2>

<p>Like virtualization, chroots provide the guest OS with their own, segregated
file system to run in, allowing applications to run in a different binary
environment from the host OS. Unlike virtualization, you are <em>not</em> booting a
second OS; instead, the guest OS is running using the Chromium OS system. The
benefit to this is that there is zero speed penalty since everything is run
natively, and you aren't wasting RAM to boot two OSes at the same time. The
downside is that you must be running the correct chroot for your hardware, the
software must be compatible with Chromium OS's kernel, and machine resources are
inextricably tied between the host Chromium OS and the guest OS. What this means
is that while the chroot cannot directly access files outside of its view, it
<em>can</em> access all of your hardware devices, including the entire contents of
memory. A root exploit in your guest OS will essentially have unfettered access
to the rest of Chromium OS.</p>

<p>...but hey, you can run TuxRacer!</p>

<h2>
<a name="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>You need a device running Chromium OS that has been switched to developer mode.
Note that developer mode, in its default configuration, is <em>completely
insecure</em>, so don't expect a password in your chroot to keep anyone from your
data. crouton does support encrypting chroots, but the encryption is only as
strong as the quality of your passphrase. Consider this your warning.</p>

<p>That's it! Surprised?</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>crouton is a powerful tool, and there are a <em>lot</em> of features, but basic usage
is as simple as possible by design.</p>

<p>If you're just here to use crouton, you can grab the latest release from
<a href="http://goo.gl/fd3zc">goo.gl/fd3zc</a>. Download it, pop open a shell
(Ctrl+Alt+T, type <code>shell</code> and hit enter), and run <code>sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton</code> to
see the help text. See the "examples" section for some usage examples.</p>

<p>If you're modifying crouton, you'll probably want to clone or download the repo
and then either run <code>installer/main.sh</code> directly, or use <code>make</code> to build your
very own <code>crouton</code>. You can also download the latest release, cd into the
Downloads folder, and run <code>sh -e crouton -x</code> to extract out the juicy scripts
contained within, but you'll be missing build-time stuff like the Makefile.</p>

<p>crouton uses the concept of "targets" to decide what to install. While you will
have apt-get in your chroot, some targets may need minor hacks to avoid issues
when running in the chrooted environment. As such, if you expect to want
something that is fulfilled by a target, install that target when you make the
chroot and you'll have an easier time.  Don't worry if you forget to include a
target; you can always update the chroot later and add it. You can see the list
of available targets by running <code>sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t help</code>.</p>

<p>Once you've set up your chroot, you can easily enter it using the
newly-installed <code>enter-chroot</code> command, or one of the target-specific
start* commands. Ta-da! That was easy.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <code>crouton</code>
</li>
<li>Open a shell (Ctrl+Alt+T, type <code>shell</code> and hit enter) and run
 <code>sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce</code>
</li>
<li>Wait patiently and answer the prompts like a good person.</li>
<li>Done! You can jump straight to your Xfce session by running
 <code>sudo enter-chroot startxfce4</code> or, as a special shortcut, <code>sudo startxfce4</code>
</li>
<li>Cycle through Chromium OS and your running graphical chroots using
 Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Back and Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Forward.</li>
<li>Exit the chroot by logging out of Xfce.</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="with-encryption" class="anchor" href="#with-encryption"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>With encryption!</h3>

<ol>
<li>Add the <code>-e</code> parameter when you run crouton to create an encrypted chroot.</li>
<li>You can get some extra protection on your chroot by storing the decryption
 key separately from the place the chroot is stored. Use the <code>-k</code> parameter
 to specify a file or directory to store the keys in (such as a USB drive or
 SD card) when you create the chroot. Beware that if you lose this file,
 your chroot will not be decryptable. That's kind of the point, of course.</li>

<ol>
<li>The <code>-r</code> parameter specifies which distro release you want to use.</li>
<li>Run <code>sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -r list</code> to list the recognized releases and
 which distros they belong to.</li>

<ol>
<li>You can save a chunk of space by ditching X and just installing
 command-line tools using <code>-t core</code> or <code>-t cli-extra</code>
</li>
<li>Enter the chroot in as many crosh shells as you want simultaneously using
 <code>sudo enter-chroot</code>
</li>
<li>Use the <a href="http://goo.gl/eczLT">Crosh Window</a> extension to keep Chromium OS
 from eating standard keyboard shortcuts.</li>

<ol>
<li>Check for updates, download the latest version, and see what's new by
 running <code>croutonversion -u -d -c</code> from the chroot (run <code>croutonversion -h</code>
 to see what those parameters actually do).</li>
<li>Exit the chroot and run <code>sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -u -n chrootname</code>.
 It will update all installed targets.</li>
<li>You can use this with <code>-e</code> to encrypt a non-encrypted chroot, but make sure
 you don't interrupt the operation.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<code>sudo edit-chroot -b chrootname</code> backs up your chroot to a timestamped
 tarball in the current directory. Chroots are named either via the <code>-n</code>
 parameter when created or by the release name if -n was not specified.</li>
<li>
<code>sudo edit-chroot -r chrootname</code> restores the chroot from the most recent
 timestamped tarball. You can explicitly specify the tarball with <code>-f</code>
</li>
<li>If your machine is new, powerwashed, or held upside-down and shaken, you
 can use the crouton installer to restore a chroot and relevant scripts:
 <code>sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -f mybackup.tar.gz</code>
</li>
</ol><p><em>Unlike with Chromium OS, the data in your chroot isn't synced to the cloud.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Check out the <code>edit-chroot</code> command; it likely does what you need it to do.</li>
<li>If you set a Chromium OS root password, you can change it with
 <code>sudo chromeos-setdevpasswd</code>

<ol>
<li>Use <code>-p</code> to specify the directory in which to install the chroot and
 scripts. Be sure to quote or escape spaces.</li>
<li>When entering the chroot, either specify the full path of the enter-chroot
 or start* scripts (i.e. <code>sudo sh -e /path/to/enter-chroot</code>), or use the
 <code>-c</code> parameter to explicitly specify the chroots directory.</li>

</li>
<li>Include the <code>-r</code> parameter if you want to specify for which release to
 prepare a bootstrap.</li>
<li>You can then create chroots using the tarball by running
 <code>sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -f ~/Downloads/mybootstrap.tar.bz2</code>
</li>

<ol>
<li>You can make your own target files (start by copying one of the existing
 ones) and then use them with any version of crouton via the <code>-T</code> parameter.</li>

<li>The delete-chroot command is your sword, shield, and only true friend.
 <code>sudo delete-chroot evilchroot</code>

<a name="tips" class="anchor" href="#tips"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Chroots are cheap! Create multiple ones using <code>-n</code>, break them, then make
new, better ones!</li>
<li>You can change the distro mirror from the default by using <code>-m</code>
</li>
<li>Behind a proxy? <code>-P</code> lets you specify one.</li>
<li>A script is installed in your chroot called <code>brightness</code>. You can assign
this to keyboard shortcuts to adjust the brightness of the screen (e.g.
<code>brightness up</code>) or keyboard (e.g. <code>brightness k down</code>).</li>
<li>Multiple monitors will work fine in the chroot, but you may have to switch
to Chromium OS and back to enable them.</li>
<li>You can make commands run in the background so that you can close the
terminal. This is particularly useful for desktop environments: try running
<code>sudo startxfce4 -b</code>
</li>
<li>Want to disable Chromium OS's power management? Run <code>croutonpowerd -i</code>
</li>
<li>Only want power management disabled for the duration of a command?
<code>croutonpowerd -i command and arguments</code> will automatically stop inhibiting
power management when the command exits.</li>
<li>Have a Pixel or two or 4.352 million? <code>-t touch</code> improves touch support.</li>

<a name="issues" class="anchor" href="#issues"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Issues?</h2>

<p>Running another OS in a chroot is a pretty messy technique (although it's hidden
behind very pretty scripts), and these scripts are relatively new, so problems
are not surprising. Check the issue tracker and file a bug if your issue isn't
there. When filing a new bug, include the output of <code>croutonversion</code> run from
inside the chroot (if possible).</p>

<h2>
<a name="can-i-help" class="anchor" href="#can-i-help"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Can I help?</h2>

<p>Yes!</p>

<h2>
<a name="but-how" class="anchor" href="#but-how"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>But how?</h2>

<p>There's a way For Everyone to help!</p>

<ul>
<li>Something broken? File a bug! Bonus points if you try to fix it. It helps if
you provide the output of <code>croutonversion</code> when you submit the bug.</li>
<li>Want to try and break something? Look through <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues?labels=needstesting&amp;state=open">requests for testing</a>
and then do your best to brutally rip the author's work to shreds.</li>
<li>Look through <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues?state=open">open issues</a>
and see if there's a topic or application you happen to have experience
with. And then, preferably, share that experience with others.</li>
<li>Find issues that need <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues?labels=needswiki&amp;state=open,closed">wiki entries</a>
and add the relevant info to the <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki">wiki</a>.
Or just add things to/improve things in the wiki in general, but do try to
keep it relevant and organized.</li>
<li>Really like a certain desktop environment? Open or comment on a bug with
steps to get things working well. Or better yet, create a pull request with
a new target.</li>
<li>Feel like hacking around with Chromium OS integration? Fork crouton, improve
integration, and create a pull request.</li>
<li>Is your distro underrepresented? Want to contribute to the elusive and
mythical beast known as "croagh"? Fork crouton, add the distro, and create a
pull request.</li>
<li>Hang out in the #crouton IRC channel on freenode.net!</li>
